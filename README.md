# TTS for Non-Verbal Communication
I constantly find it extremly hard to verbally talk to people. While using text in voice chats work, you usually have to wait for the person/people you are talking to to read the message. I'm developing this app to get around that, making it easier for both myself and the people I chat with.

This app enables individuals to communicate using text-to-speech functionality. Users type into a text box, hit 'Speak', and the app converts the text into speech, outputting it as a microphone output (using VB-Cable).

**This app currently in alpha and only works on Windows systems.**
