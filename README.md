# TTS for Non-Verbal Communication
This app enables non-verbal individuals to communicate using text-to-speech functionality. As a non-verbal individual myself, I understand the importance of having tools to facilitate communication. Users type into a text box, hit 'Speak', and the app converts the text into speech, outputting it as a microphone output (using VB-Cable).

This app currently only works on Windows systems.
